# https-configuration-tool

This project is an HTTPS configuration tool, specifically meant for Bitnami solutions. It is a really early version of the [Bitnami HTTPS Configuration Tool](https://docs.bitnami.com/general/how-to/understand-bncert/).

The tool was developed as my Final Year Project in the University of Seville. As such, this repository is not supported and may not work with the latest Bitnami installations. Users are encouraged to use the [official tool](https://docs.bitnami.com/general/how-to/understand-bncert/) instead.

## Requirements

* [VMware InstallBuilder](https://installbuilder.com/) (build-time only)
* Internet access (both at build-time and runtime)

## Build the tool

```
$ ./build.sh
```
